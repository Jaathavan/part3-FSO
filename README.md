My solution to phonebook backend for FullStackOpen 2022 part 3

App link: https://tranquil-shore-20290.herokuapp.com

It is a simple fullkstack phonebook App using tools such as:
- Mongoose
* Express
+ React
- Node
* Heroku
+ MongoDB
- Eslint
* Postman
- and more ...

P.S. Alan Turing is quite special

Heroku stopped offering free dynos so now it doesn't work :(
Also the Alan Turing message was that his number was in binary and when you translate from binary it is his birthday
